# CTA - Cumulative Technical Assessment -

## This is the final assessment for Modules 1-4

This assessment will touch on all the knowledge you've gained in the last few modules.

To do this, you'll be building a `Store App` - a single model CRUD app API, using RESTful routes and consuming it with a `create-react-app` front-end.

This is an individual assessment, so you may not collaborate iwtih your peers or anyone outside of your instructors.

This assessment is open book - you may reference your notes, previous work and use MDN/W3 schools

Your instructors will be available to clarify instructions or help with technical issues.


It is strongly encouraged/recommended that you:

- Deploy the template app
- Create [wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/learn/articles/what-are-wireframes/) and put the user stories in your own words BEFORE beginning your app. Having a good plan and a clear idea of what you are building will help you focus on coding and help you avoid some refactoring
- Make a daily schedule for yourself with clear and achievable milestones
- Work on the back-end and fully test your routes with Postman
- Work on the front-end following [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
- Work on bonus features last
